          Hello! I'm Jathushan and I'm a 4th year student at the University of Waterloo studying Biomedical Engineering.
          <br/>
          <p>
            My passions revolve around producing innovative solutions within the healthcare sector, and I'm always eager to tackle new challenges! I have extensive experience as a Full Stack Developer at several biotech companies and hospitals, and am currently looking for full-time post-grad opportunities.
            Outside of my work and school life, I am interested in all forms of media: music, film, print, etc. I am also an avid NBA and (more recently) NFL fan, and love to partake in sports and athletics<span aria-label="smiley" role="img">ðŸ˜ƒ</span>
